How to use these files, using the players table as an example

**Step 0**: Create database and prerequisite tables, with required cols

**Step 1**: Create and click into the players table in phpmyadmin

**Step 2**: Click import

**Step 3**: Choose players.csv file in file browser

**Step 4**: Paste the following column names into the "Column names" box: f_name,l_name,position,cap,age

Note: The column names may have to be changed if you named them differently in step 0

## Future features:
- Automatically push to database
- ~~Fix having to define the line ending~~âœ”
- Generate id (already works, not implemented) so that you don't have to define columns
