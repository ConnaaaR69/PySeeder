# Usage:

**!!! Make sure Python is installed and set up in your system environment  if you want to run the script yourself!!!**

How to use these files, using the players table as an example

**Step 0**: Create MySQL database and prerequisite tables, with required cols
**Step 1**: run seed.py
**Step 2**: enter teams to create
**Step 3**: complete, review in terminal or in dbms


Note: The column names may have to be changed if you named them differently in step 0

## Future features:
- ~~Automatically push to database~~✔
- ~~Fix having to define the line ending~~✔
- ~~Generate id (already works, not implemented) so that you don't have to define columns~~✔
